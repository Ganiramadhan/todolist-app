# Todo Application

Description: This repository contains code for a simple todo application that allows users to add, delete, and manage their list of tasks. The application is built using React for the client side and Express for the server side. It features a responsive design, modern gradients, and integration with SweetAlert2 for user action confirmation. Additionally, the application uses Supabase as the backend for database management and real-time data synchronization.
